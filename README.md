# Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 📌 Objective
To identify potentially harmful browser extensions, review their permissions, and remove suspicious or unnecessary add-ons to enhance browser security and browsing performance.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (Extensions Manager)

---

## 📋 Steps I Followed

### **1. Opened Chrome’s Extension Manager**
- Navigated to: Menu (⋮) → Extensions → Manage Extensions

### **2. Reviewed All Installed Extensions**
Since my extensions list was empty, I verified that:
- No unknown extensions were installed  
- No extensions with high permissions were present  
- No add-ons were affecting browser performance or security  

### **3. Checked for Suspicious or Unused Extensions**
I looked for:
- Unknown developers  
- Extensions requiring excessive permissions  
- Add-ons I didn’t remember installing  

Since the list was empty, there were **no suspicious or unused extensions** to review.

### **4. Removed Extensions (If Needed)**
No extensions were installed, so **no removal was necessary**.

### **5. Restarted the Browser**
Restarted Chrome to ensure:
- No hidden extensions were still active  
- Smooth and stable performance  

### **6. Researched How Malicious Extensions Work**
Understood how malicious browser add-ons can compromise privacy, hijack search pages, or inject unwanted advertisements.

## 🔍 Suspicious Extensions Found

### **✔ Option Used — No Suspicious Extensions Found**
My browser had **no extensions installed**, so:
- No harmful add-ons were detected  
- No extensions required removal  

The empty extension page confirms that the browser was in a clean and secure state.

## ⚠️ Risks of Malicious Browser Extensions
Malicious or poorly coded extensions can:
- Track browsing activity  
- Steal cookies or login details  
- Inject ads and pop-ups  
- Redirect search results  
- Record keystrokes  
- Install hidden malware or crypto-miners  
- Change homepage or search engine settings  
- Sell user data to third-party advertisers  

This shows why extension audits are important.

- The importance of maintaining a clean extension list

## 📸 Screenshots Included
All screenshots are saved in the **Screenshots/** folder:

1. **extensions-page.png**  
   – Shows that the Chrome extensions list was empty.

2. **suspicious-extension.png**  
   – Since no suspicious extensions were found, this screenshot repeats the same empty extensions page.

3. **after-removal.png**  
   – As no extensions were installed, the browser looked the same after the audit.
