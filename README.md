## 📌 Objective
To identify potentially harmful browser extensions, review their permissions, and remove suspicious or unnecessary add-ons to improve browser security and browsing performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (Extensions Manager)

---

## 📋 Steps I Followed

### **1. Opened Chrome’s Extension Manager**
- Went to: Menu (⋮) → Extensions → Manage Extensions

### **2. Reviewed All Installed Extensions**
I checked each extension for:
- Developer authenticity  
- Reviews and ratings  
- Permission requests  
- Whether I intentionally installed it  
- Any unusual behaviour like ads, redirects, or pop-ups  

### **3. Identified Unused or Suspicious Extensions**
I looked for:
- Unknown developers  
- Extensions I didn’t remember installing  
- Too many permissions (e.g., “read and change all your data”)  
- Low-rated or untrusted add-ons  

### **4. Removed Suspicious / Unnecessary Extensions**
Used the **Remove** button to delete anything unsafe or unused.

### **5. Restarted the Browser**
Checked if:
- Performance improved  
- Redirect issues stopped  
- No unexpected ads appeared  

### **6. Researched How Malicious Extensions Work**
Learned how harmful add-ons affect privacy and browser safety.

## ⚠️ Risks of Malicious Browser Extensions
Malicious extensions can:

- Track browsing activity  
- Steal login data or cookies  
- Inject ads or redirect search results  
- Log keystrokes  
- Install malware/crypto miners  
- Modify homepage or search engine

This highlights why extension audits are important.
